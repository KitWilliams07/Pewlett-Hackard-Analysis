# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
This analysis was required for Pewlett-Hackard to look ahead and determine potential hiring needs as the generation of baby boomers begin to retire. 

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was two-fold. The main goals of the analysis were to determine the number of employees that were retiring as well which of these employees would be eligible for the Mentorship Program. The Mentorship Program would be created for retiring employees to slowly phase out of the company by offering guidance to new employees before they decide to fully retire.

## Results 
Pewlett-Hackard allowed access to their database of numerous files that hold employee information. These tables were combined and manipulated to yield the necessary information for the analysis.

The first query resulted in a table that highlighted the baby boomer employees who were set to retire soon. The table includes each employees name, as well as their employee number, job title, and years of employement. (The year 9999-01-01 indicates the employee still works there).
